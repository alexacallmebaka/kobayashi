# What is Kobayashi?

Kobayashi is a tool for generating static websites! It takes files written in the `.kby`
markup and transforms them into `html`.

For the full rundown on how to install and use Kobayashi, check out the [user manual](https://jameshurd.net/projects/kobayashi/manual/).

# Code Styling

Where applicable, I am trying to follow [Kowanik's Haskell Style Guide](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide).
